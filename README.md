# Delta_Training_Rule
Description: 
Implementation of delta training rule for a two-input linear unit. 

Complete Problem is explained in 'Delta training rule project.docx' file which is in the 'Problem' folder.

Steps to rule the MATLAB code:

--> Initially run the file 'training.m' to see the decision surface and plotting of error in Decision.png and error.png pictures which are available in results folder..
--> Also run 'Training_1_d.m' to see the error plot in batch size in 'batch.png' picture.
--> To see the dampening effect run the 'dampeningeffect_2_a.m' file and can see the results in 'Dampeningeffect_2_a.png'.
--> To see the adapterative effect run the 'adapterative_2_b.m' file and can see the results in 'adapterative_2_b.png'.
